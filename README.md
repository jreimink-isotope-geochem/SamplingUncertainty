# SamplingUncertainty
Modeling geochemical sampling uncertainty

This app is currently live and operating at the following location: https://discordance.geosc.psu.edu/SamplingUncertainty/

This app was written by Jesse Reimink and Tom Chacko and is largely based on the sampling error algorithms of Stanley (2003) but also incorporates the effects of closure on uncertainty estimates associated with whole-rock compositions

all measurements are in grams and cm^3, including output values
