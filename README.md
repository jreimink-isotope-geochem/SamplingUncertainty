# SamplingUncertainty
Modeling geochemical sampling uncertainty

This app was written by
Drs. Jesse Reimink and Tom Chacko
and is largely based on the sampling error algorithms of
Stanley (2003) but also incorporate the effects of closure on
uncertainty estimates associated with whole-rock compositions

all measurements are in grams and cm^3, including output values
